This is a static form created for practicing HTML and CSS skills, particularly focusing on form design and styling. It does not include backend functionality for form submission.

The `tandc.html` file is currently a placeholder and will be updated in the future to include actual terms and conditions content. This project was created as a practice exercise to simulate what an actual registration form would be like, including all necessary components such as a terms and conditions agreement.
